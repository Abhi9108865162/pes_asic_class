# VLSI Physical Design For ASIC
<br>

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of chip design using the RISC-V architecture. It covers key topics like design cycles, specifications, and SoC development. Students learn about analog IPs, mixed-signal flows, and gain hands-on experience with RISC-V-based SoC design. The curriculum also introduces process design kits, libraries, Verilog RTL design, synthesis, and the RTL-to-GDS flow for complete chip development. The course offers both theoretical insights and practical labs to equip students with essential skills in chip design.

## Skill Outcomes
1. Architectural Design
2. RTL Design/Behavioral Modeling
3. Floorplanning
4. Placement
5. CTS
6. Routing

## Skill Objectives:
• Prototype design ideas and enable low-volume chip design production with minimal
knowledge about tools
• Submit a silicon-ready datasheet and an IEEE format paper about their design
prototype.

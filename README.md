## Day - 2
# Using ABI (Application Binary Interface) function calls in lab work typically involves working with low-level programming languages like Assembly or understanding how different programming languages interact at the binary level. Here's a general outline of what lab work involving ABI function calls might entail:

## Lab Objective: To understand and demonstrate the usage of ABI function calls in programming.

Steps:

    Select a Programming Language: Choose a programming language in which you'll demonstrate ABI function calls. Common choices include Assembly, C, or C++.

    Write Simple Functions: Create a few simple functions in the chosen language. These functions will serve as examples for demonstrating ABI function calls. Make sure to include functions with parameters and return values.

    1. Compile Code: Compile the code into object files or binaries, depending on the chosen language.

    2. View Binary Code: Use tools like objdump or disassemblers to view the binary code of the compiled program. This will help you understand how the function calls are translated into machine instructions.

    3. Create a Calling Program: Write a calling program that calls the functions you defined earlier. This calling program will demonstrate how function calls are made according to the ABI.

    4. Parameter Passing: Experiment with different parameter passing methods based on the ABI. For example, observe how arguments are passed using registers or the stack.

    5. Return Values: Explore how return values are handled. Understand which registers or memory locations are used to store the return values.

    6. Calling Conventions: Study the specific calling conventions for your chosen language and platform. Different ABIs have different rules for parameter passing, register usage, and stack management.

    7. Debugging and Analysis: Use debugging tools to step through the calling program and observe the behavior of function calls. This will help you understand how the ABI dictates the interaction between the caller and the callee.

    8. Documentation: Document your observations and findings regarding how ABI function calls work in the chosen programming language. Include explanations of parameter passing, return values, and any specific conventions you've explored.

    9. Presentation: If required, present your lab work to the class, highlighting the importance of ABI in enabling interoperability between different software components.

### By working through these steps, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how ABI function calls facilitate communication between different parts of a program, even when they are written in different programming languages or compiled separately. This lab work is valuable for students studying computer science, computer engineering, or any field involving low-level programming and system interactions.
